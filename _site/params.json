Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n![Tree](http://i.imgur.com/duMuL99.gif)\r\n\r\n### Why this page?\r\nI made this page as a sort of homepage for my projects. I will have links to my project pages, and might use this page as a nameplate page for links relating to me.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
